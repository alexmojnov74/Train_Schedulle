## Train_Schedulle

# Overview
In this assignment, the objective was to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulates the data with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

# Requirements
App must suit these basic specs:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
 * Train Name
 * Destination
 * First Train Time -- in military time
 * Frequency -- in minutes
 * Calculate when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.

# Additional Features added:
- Modal Pop Up for entering User Data
- No activity detection
- Added First Train Time for user friendy interface
